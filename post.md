Most of the supervised deep learning algorithms optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values (weights).  With Neural Style Transfer, we optimize a cost function to get pixel values of a generated image. This algorithm is, therefore, considered an unsupervised deep learning due to absence of a labeled target.
